<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!
Thanks to your website, users will play Pong with others. You will provide a nice user
interface, a chat, and real-time multiplayer online games!</p>
<h2 id="mandatory-part">Mandatory part</h2>
<p>Your work has to comply with the following rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your website backend must be written in NestJS.</li>
<li>The frontend must be written with a TypeScript framework of your choice.</li>
<li>You are free to use any library you want to in this context. However, you must use
the latest stable version of every library or framework used in your project.</li>
<li>You must use a PostgreSQL database. That’s it, no other database.</li>
<li>Your website must be a single-page application. The user should be able to use the
Back and Forward buttons of the browser.</li>
<li>Your website must be compatible with the latest stable up-to-date version of
Google Chrome and one additional web browser of your choice.</li>
<li>The user should encounter no unhandled errors and no warnings when browsing the
website.</li>
<li>Everything has to be launch by a single call to: docker-compose up --build</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="security-concerns">Security concerns</h2>
<p>In order to create a fully functional website, here are a few security concerns that you
have to tackle:</p>
<ul>
<li>Any password stored in your database must be hashed.</li>
<li>Your website must be protected against SQL injections.</li>
<li>You must implement some kind of server-side validation for forms and any user
input.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="user-account">User Account</h2>
<ul>
<li>The user must login using the OAuth system of 42 intranet.</li>
<li>The user should be able to choose a unique name that will be displayed on the
website.</li>
<li>The user should be able to upload an avatar. If the user doesn’t upload an avatar,
a default one must be set.</li>
<li>The user should be able to enable two-factor authentication. For instance,
Google Authenticator or sending a text message to their phone.</li>
<li>The user should be able to add other users as friends and see their current status
(online, offline, in a game, and so forth).</li>
<li>Stats (such as: wins and losses, ladder level, achievements, and so forth) have to
be displayed on the user profile.</li>
<li>Each user should have a Match History including 1v1 games, ladder, and any-
thing else useful. Anyone who is logged in should be able to consult it.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="chat">Chat</h2>
<p>You also have to create a chat for your users:</p>
<ul>
<li>The user should be able to create channels (chat rooms) that can be either public,
or private, or protected by a password.</li>
<li>The user should be able to send direct messages to other users.</li>
<li>The user should be able to block other users. This way, they will see no more
messages from the account they blocked.</li>
<li>The user who has created a new channel is automatically set as the channel owner
until they leave it.
<ul>
<li>The channel owner can set a password required to access the channel, change
it, and also remove it.</li>
<li>The channel owner is a channel administrator. They can set other users as
administrators.</li>
<li>A user who is an administrator of a channel can kick, ban or mute (for a
limited time) other users, but not the channel owners.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The user should be able to invite other users to play a Pong game through the chat
interface.</li>
<li>The user should be able to access other players profiles through the chat interface.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="game">Game</h2>
<p>The main purpose of this website is to play Pong versus other players.</p>
<ul>
<li>Therefore, users should be able to play a live Pong game versus another player
directly on the website.</li>
<li>There must be a matchmaking system: the user can join a queue until they get
automatically matched with someone else.</li>
<li>It can be a canvas game, or it can be a game rendered in 3D, it can also be ugly,
but in any case, it must be faithful to the original Pong (1972).</li>
<li>You must offer some customization options (for example, power-ups or different
maps). However, the user should be able to select a default version of the game
without any extra features if they want to.</li>
<li>The game must be responsive!</li>
</ul>
