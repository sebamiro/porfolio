# 42 School

Is a private institution of higher education in computer science.
The education model focuses on project-based learning and teamwork,
rather than theoretical education.
<br><br>
The school has no teachers and is open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
so as students we learn to manage our own time and project deadlines.
It is also up to us find aswers, here is where the peer-to-peer takes place,
asking other students to show you and explain things that you in turn will
learn and transmit to someone else, or by approaching someone struggling with
the same problem, you can share your thoughts and perspectives, allows you
to move forward and sharpen your skills through research, experimentation
and defending your personal approach to a given problem.<br>
