# Push_swap

Is an individual project about creating two-stack integer sorting algorithm,
using a predefined set of instructions

		sa:   swaps the 2 top elements of stack a
		sb:   swaps the 2 top elements of stack b
		ss:   both sa and sb
		pa:   moves the top element of stack b at the top of stack a
		pb:   moves the top element of stack a at the top of stack b
		ra:   shifts all elements of stack a from bottom to top
		rb:   shifts all elements of stack b from bottom to top
		rr:   both ra and rb
		rra:  shifts all elements of stack a from top to bottom
		rrb:  shifts all elements of stack b from top to bottom
		rrr:  both rra and rrb
